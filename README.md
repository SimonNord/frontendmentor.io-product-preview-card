## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS library
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS, have previously used Bootstrap and Materialize. I really liked the way Tailwind CSS works, and I will definitely try it again. however, I found it a bit hard to get the hang of it, and I had to look up a lot of things in the documentation. I also found it a bit hard to get the layout to work as I wanted it to, but I think that is because I am not used to the way Tailwind CSS works. I might have overused some media queries, but I wanted to make sure that the layout looked good on both screen sizes.
I also had some issues with the VS-code extension Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, the autocomplete function did not work as intended or at all.

An example of a div with many classes::

```html
<div
  class="flex flex-col gap-y-3 md:gap-y-6 p-6 md:px-10 md:py-6 font-montserrat text-sm text-grayBlue md:w-80"
>
```

### Useful resources

- [Try Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - If you haven't tried Tailwind CSS yet, I would recommend you to try it out. It is a great CSS framework, and as I said above, I will definitely practice more with it.
